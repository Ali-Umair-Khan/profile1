    {question:'How much you charge?', answer:'I employ a flexible pricing structure based on the specific requirements of each project, with compensation for services falling within the range of $40 to $50 per hour. The total charges are determined by the scope and intricacy of the assigned task.', isOpen:true},
    {question:'How much time you take to complete a project?', answer:'The completion timeframe for a project is contingent upon the intricacy of the tasks involved. For instance, the crafting of a singular section of a webpage demands a span of 1 to 3 hours of concentrated effort, contingent upon the complexity of said section. Consequently, the comprehensive development of an entire website may necessitate an estimated duration of 3 to 4 days, accounting for the diverse intricacies embedded within its constituent sections.', isOpen:false},
    {question:'How much time you take to complete webapps and webpages?', answer:'Typically, the development of a website is completed within a timeframe of 3 to 4 days, while the construction of a web application may extend to a span of 2 to 3 weeks. The discrepancy in timelines is reflective of the heightened complexity and comprehensive functionality inherent in the design and implementation of web applications compared to standard websites.', isOpen:false},
    {question:'Do you issue refunds?', answer:'No, I don`t. I understand that you recognize potential challenges from my standpoint. To minimize uncertainties, starting with a smaller project seems sensible. This approach provides an opportunity for a gradual introduction, allowing for the assessment of our collaboration. If the outcomes meet your expectations, we can then consider expanding our cooperation to larger projects.', isOpen:false},
    {question:'Is there an additional fee for extra revisions?', answer:'No, there is not. Rest assured that when we commence our collaboration, your payment ensures you receive precisely the designs you envisioned. There are no unexpected charges for supplementary revisions.', isOpen:false},
    {question:'How do you go about coding an app or website?', answer:'Following our goal-setting discussion, I immediately dive into the development process. The intricacies of the coding process involve a touch of magic, where I seek inspiration, amalgamate ideas, and craft solutions tailored to address the specific problem at hand.Throughout the design phase, your involvement is entirely at your discretion. I lean towards a collaborative "done with you" approach, valuing your input and ensuring the creation aligns with your vision rather than a more detached "done for you" method.', isOpen:false},
    {question:'What do you require to initiate the process?', answer:'We can embark on the project with a blank canvas. All I need from you is a clear vision of what you aim to create. Alternatively, if you already possess existing code, we can utilize it as a foundational starting point. Alternatively, we can choose to discard them and commence the project anew.', isOpen:false},
